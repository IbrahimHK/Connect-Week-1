<p> <font size="4"> When <b> <i> MJ </b> </i>  was inaugurated into the <b> Basketball Hall of Fame in 2009 </b>, he closed his speech by saying <u>�Limits, like fears, are often just an illusion.� </u> </font>

<font size="4"> To celebrate the <b>35th</b> anniversary of his speech, the shoe that started it all is unafraid to return to the court as part of the <i>'Fearless Ones'</i> series. </font>

<p> <font color="purple" size="3"> Since his game-winning shot that brought championship glory to North Carolina, Michael Jordan has been at the forefront of basketball consciousness. He took the court in 1985 wearing the original Air Jordan I, simultaneously breaking league rules and his opponents' will while capturing the imagination of fans worldwide. </font>
